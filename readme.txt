This app tracks your app usage by manual input.
More ambitious versions were attempted, but dropped due to time constraints.

There are only three pages in total: 
index.html is the sign-up page.
landing page.html is barely in use currently.
main.html is the home page.

There are also really only two .js file relevant to the final project. 
create_user.js and app.js can be combined, but are both essential to the project.
The other two are dropped attempts at dynamic options.
