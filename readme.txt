This app tracks your app usage by manual input.
A more ambitious version were attempted, but dropped due to time constraints.

There are only three pages in total: 
index.html is the sign-up page.
landing page.html is barely in use currently, it's now the "about us" page just to make some use of it.
main.html is the home page.

There are also really only two .js file relevant to the final project. 
create_user.js and app.js can be combined, but are both essential to the project.
app_dynamic_unfinished is a dropped attempt at dynamically creating options instead of clunky presets.
